# NoSQLiLab in a Vagrant 

A set of files to establish Vagrant virtual machines for your NoSQLiLab are included in the project. With them you can quickly establish a testing range and begin your challenges in a virtual environment.

# Installation

1. If you need to, [Install Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/installation/) for your platform (Windows, OSX, Linux).
2. In the top level directory of this repository, run `vagrant up` to launch the virtual machine. If this is the first time you've done so it will download the base image and provision the required software (Apache with PHP, MongoDB, this repository, etc)

Once this launches you can visit, browse http://localhost:8080/ and get to work. Reset the database and start the challenges.
