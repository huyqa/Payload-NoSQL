# NoSQLi Lab

With the rise in popularity of NoSQL I figured it was time to build a lab so I
could have a play with the different techniques used to attack them. This lab
was the result.

Seeing as I've already played with Redis for some development work I decided to
go with MongoDB here. I have built two different scenarios in this lab, an
equivalent of the SQLi `" or 1=1"` vulnerability and also a new type of attack,
which is specific to NoSQL, script injection. I might add more later but these
were good for a start.
